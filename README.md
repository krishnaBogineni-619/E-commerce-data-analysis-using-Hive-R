# E-commerce-data-analysis-using-Hive-R
- Performed KPIs analysis on an e-commerce dataset by leveraging the Hadoop ecosystem, using HDFS for data ingestion and Hive for query processing. Utilized R to uncover insights.
#### Key Features  
1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - Dataset loaded into **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)** for scalable storage and processing.  
   - CSV-formatted transaction records including customer demographics, purchase details, and product categories.

2. **Data Processing with Hive**:  
   - SQL-like querying for data manipulation and analysis.  
   - Partitioning and bucketing for optimized query performance.  
   - Data cleaning, transformation, and KPI computation.

3. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:  
   - Total Sales, Average Order Value (AOV), Customer Count, Repeat Purchase Rate.  
   - Sales segmentation by demographics, product categories, and location.  
   - Analysis of discount usage, purchase methods, and seasonal trends.  

4. **Visualization and Insights**:  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis using tools like **R** for visualizing trends across demographics, sales patterns, and promotional impacts.  
   - Graphs and charts for KPIs, sales trends, and customer behaviors.

5. **Key Outcomes**:  
   - Customer segmentation insights for targeted marketing.  
   - Recommendations for inventory management and discount strategies.  
   - Identification of high-performing product categories and sales channels.
